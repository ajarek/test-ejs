                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to templating using EJS</p>
                    <p>In this article, you learned how to apply EJS to an Express application, include repeatable parts
                        of your site, and pass data to the views.
                        EJS lets you build applications when you do not require additional complexity. By using partials
                        and having the ability to easily pass variables to your views, you can build some great
                        applications quickly.
                        Consult the EJS documentation for additional information on features and syntax. Consult
                        Comparing JavaScript Templating Engines: Jade, Mustache, Dust and More for understanding the
                        pros and cons of different view engines.</p>

                    <p>What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.</p>
                    <h3>Fast development time</h3>
                    <p>
                        Don't waste time and attention figuring out arcane new syntax because 'elegance' â€” or how to preprocess your data so it will actually render right.</p>
